## Description of notebooks
To compare the results of the proposed method with baselines we considered PCMCI+, DYNOTEARS, NTS-NOTEARS, PCMCI, NOTEARS-MLP, and DAG-GNN. This repository contains notebooks with the results for different datasets from all baseline models. A brief summary of notebooks is given below. 

- Baseline_Models_Applied_On_SEA_ICE_Data.ipynb: All baseline methods are applied to Arctic Sea Ice data in this notebook.
- Baseline_Models_Applied_On_TKE_Data.ipynb: All baseline methods are applied to the Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE) dataset in this notebook.
- Baseline_Models_Applied_On_Synthetic_Dataset_1.ipynb: All baseline methods are applied to the synthetic Dataset-1 in this notebook.
- Baseline_Models_Applied_On_Synthetic_Dataset_2.ipynb: In this notebook, we applied all baseline methods to the synthetic Dataset-2.
